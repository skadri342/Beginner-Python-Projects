Simple beginner python program learning more about functions and return statements to make a simple calculator app. This calculator app allows you to make calculations with 2 or more numbers, allowing you to calculate with the previous results if you want. This program also touches on recursion very simply. Recursion is a very complex topic so I still have a lot to learn about that.
