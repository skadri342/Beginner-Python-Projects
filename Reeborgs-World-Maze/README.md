This was a code for the reeborgs world website: https://reeborg.ca/reeborg.html

Learned to use while loops and functions. This code had a kind of hard problem that took me a long time to figure out. There were some cases where the robot's starting position would cause the code to be in an infinite loop. To figure that out I had to find out what the problem was. It was whenever the robot started in a position with no wall on it's right side it will end up in an infinite loop. Since the robot is using the right wall to follow all the way till the end, if there is no wall at the starting position, it ends up in an infinite loop. To solve this at the start I made sure that the robot just kept going until it reached a wall then turn left to make sure that there is a wall on it's right side.
