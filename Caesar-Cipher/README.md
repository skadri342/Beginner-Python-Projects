Made a super simple encrypting and decodign program using what I have learned about lists, functions, while loops, and for loops.
At first I had two functions but then I condensed the code into one function because the code in both of the functions were basically the same except for one line.
But putting it into one function was kind of challenging because then it introduced some bugs. I was able to fix those bugs using the Thonny debugger.
