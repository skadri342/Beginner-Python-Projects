Made a password generator as a beginner python project. Learned for loops, and the range function, and also used lists. This code can be improved a lot more and would save a few lines of code as well. Instead of the way I did the random choosing from the list, I could just use the random.choice method. Also I can just add to a list from the beginning, instead of adding to three different lists then combining it into one at the end.
